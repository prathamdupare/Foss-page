# Distractions

In today's digital age, it often feels like everyone on the internet is thirsty for your attention. Whether you're browsing through your favorite websites, scrolling through social media, or even just checking your email, it seems like every online platform is equipped with an arsenal of tools designed to keep you engaged for as long as possible. While these platforms are undoubtedly convenient and entertaining, they can also be a significant source of distraction and time-wasting.

If you're truly willing to take your productivity to the next level, it's essential to address these attention-draining leaks in your online routine. On your computer, these leaks typically manifest in the form of your web browser, the specific websites you frequent, and the content you consume. To regain control over your online activities and channel your time and energy more effectively, it's crucial to identify and seal off these leaks.

# The Setup

1. Install [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm): This top-notch ad blocker not only banishes annoying ads but also works its magic on YouTube, giving you an ad-free viewing experience.

2. Set Brave as Your Default Search: Make Brave your go-to search engine for a more privacy-focused browsing experience. You can still use it to search on Google if needed.

3. Install [Unhook](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unhook-remove-youtube-rec/khncfooichmfjbepaaaebmommgaepoid): Say goodbye to distracting YouTube features with Unhook, which helps you regain control over your video-watching experience.

4. Add [Redirector Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redirector/ocgpenflpmgnfapjedencafcfakcekcd): This handy extension allows you to customize and redirect web pages, helping you tailor your online interactions to your preferences.

I use RSS feeds to get info from internet. You can see my previous setup [here](https://fosspage.com/posts/consume-web-in-a-better-way/).
